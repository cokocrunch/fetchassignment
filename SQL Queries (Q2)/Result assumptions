Query 1: The current month is the dataset is March 2021 however it only had 1 day worth of data and had no brandCode for all entries in that day. Thus, I took Feb 2021 as the most recent month since it had more data. February only had 3 brands present while the others were null. This is something that needs to be addressed. I tried joining to the brands table but the barcodes did not match either. I assume only partnering brands would be in the database so it is common for receipt items to not be tied to a brandcode.

Query 1 is very similar to Query 6 which asks for brand popularity. I assume Query 1 is asking for unique brands within each receipt, while Query 6 asks for the count for each brand within each receipt. Query 1 looks at overall brand popularity preventing users who purchase a large portion from a specific brand to skew the data while Query 6 ignores that and wants to see all transactions for each brand. 

Query 2: For this case, I assume it is comparing how the top 5 brands for the most recent month compare to its performance for the previous month

Many of the queries has null values as the top brand due to many of the entries not having brandCode present.
